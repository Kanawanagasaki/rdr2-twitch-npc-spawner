Grand Theft Auto V mod that allows your Twitch viewers to spawn an NPC named after them. There are three tiers of rewards:
1. A random existing pedestrian will be named after your viewer. They will acknowledge your presence with a wave, after which they will continue with their activities.
2. A random pedestrian will be spawned into your world, named after your viewer. They will wave at you at close range, use their camera to take a picture at mid range, and follow you at long range.
3. A Companion will be spawned into the world, named after your viewer. They will fight on your side!
